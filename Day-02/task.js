*********************   Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations   *********************   

 • Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let valOne = 6;
let valeSec = 20;
console.log(valOne + valeSec);


 • Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let valfirst = 30;
let valeSecond = 20;
console.log(valfirst - valeSecond);

 • Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let mulOne = 43;
let mulSec = 44;
console.log(mulOne * mulSec);

 • Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let divOne = 23;
let divSec = 3;
console.log(divOne / divSec);

 • Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let remOne = 343;
let remSec = 2;
console.log(remOne % remSec);




*********************   Activity 2: Assignment Operators   *********************   

 • Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let x = 2;
let y = 5;
console.log(x += y);

 • Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let xx = 2;
let yy = 5;
console.log(xx -= yy);




*********************    Activity 3: Comparison Operators  *********************   

 • Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using › and ‹ and log the result to the console.
let val1 = 5;
let val2 = 9;
console.log(val1 > val2);
console.log(val1 < val2);

 • Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
let a = 99;
let b = 98.9;
console.log(a >= b);
console.log(a <= b);

 • Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
let c = 88;
let d = 88
let e = '88'

console.log(c == d);
console.log(c == e);
console.log(c === d);
console.log(c === e);




*********************    Activity 4: Logical Operators   *********************   

 • Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let f = 44
let g = 44
let h = 33
if (f && g == 44) {
    console.log('success');
}

 • Task 12: Write a program that uses the ll operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
if (f || h == 44) {
    console.log('success');
}

 • Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
if (f != 33) {
    console.log('success')
}



*********************    Activity 5: Ternary Operator   *********************   

 • Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the
 console.
let age = 7;

console.log(age >= 18 ? "vote" : "noVote");
